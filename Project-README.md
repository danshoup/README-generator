- The user input for description, installation, usage, contribution, and tests, is added to the appropriate section of the README.

- When the user chooses a license, a badge for that license is added to the top of the README, and a notice is added to the License section of the README that explains which license the application is covered under. 

- The user's GitHub username input is added to the questions section with a link to the user's GitHub profile.  

- The input for email address is added to the questions section of the README, with contact instructions regarding additional questions about the project.
